📝 Professional Captions for Each Graph
⭐ Tumor Pixel Distribution

This histogram shows the distribution of tumor pixel counts across all extracted 2D MRI slices. Most slices contain small tumor regions, while only a small fraction contain large tumor areas. This highlights the uneven nature of tumor spatial distribution in axial slices.

⭐ Mean Intensity Distribution

This graph illustrates the normalized mean intensity levels across all preprocessed slices. The distribution is centered around the expected normalized range (0–1), confirming successful intensity normalization.

⭐ Intensity Standard Deviation Distribution

This plot reveals texture variation across MRI slices. Higher standard deviation corresponds to more structural complexity or noise. These variations influence segmentation difficulty.

⭐ Correlation Heatmap

This heatmap shows relationships between slice-level features. Tumor pixel count positively correlates with intensity variance, suggesting that tumor regions introduce additional texture complexity.
