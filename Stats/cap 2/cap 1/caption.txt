Caption for Tumor Distribution Chart

This chart visualizes the imbalance in the BraTS 2020 dataset. Out of 57,040 2D MRI slices extracted from 368 patients, only 24,354 slices contain visible tumor tissue. The remaining 32,686 slices show healthy brain or non-tumorous regions. This imbalance highlights the challenge of brain tumor segmentation and justifies the use of targeted slice filtering during model training.

Caption for 3D MRI Volumes Chart

The BraTS 2020 dataset used in this project contains 368 complete 3D MRI volumes. Each volume is composed of approximately 155 axial slices, covering the brain from top to bottom. These volumes form the basis for 2D slice extraction and segmentation modeling.
