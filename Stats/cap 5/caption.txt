⭐ Augmentation Examples

These images demonstrate the effect of random flips, rotations, and zoom operations applied to MRI slices. Augmentation helps the U-Net model generalize by exposing it to diverse visual variations.

⭐ Mean Intensity Shift

This chart shows how augmentation affects pixel brightness. Despite minor variations, mean intensity remains stable — ensuring augmentation does not distort clinical interpretability.
